# **Max-Life 1138: Project Overview & Development Plan**

---

## **Project Name:** Max-Life 1138  
### **Genre:** Single-Player FPS, Sandbox, Life-Sim  
### **Core Inspirations:** Half-Life, THX 1138  

### **Summary:**  
Max-Life 1138 is an immersive **first-person shooter (FPS) with strong procedural generation** elements. The game takes place in a **massive underground bunker**, where citizens live under strict authoritarian rule. The player’s goal is to **survive, adapt, and eventually lead an uprising** against the regime.  

Procedural elements include:  
✅ **Randomized player character** (appearance, background, stats)  
✅ **Dynamic living quarters** (changes layout and objects each game)  
✅ **Expanding procedural environments** (apartment complex, NPCs, factions)

## **Project Goals & Features**

### **Phase 1: Core Mechanics & First Demo**  
📌 Develop **procedural character generation** (player identity randomized per session)  
📌 Implement **randomized apartment layouts** with interactable objects  
📌 Establish **basic physics interactions** inspired by Half-Life  
📌 Create minimal UI for in-game navigation  
📌 Early sandbox mechanics (day/night cycle, inventory, environmental storytelling)  

### **Phase 2: Expanding the World**  
📌 Introduce **procedurally generated apartment complex**  
📌 Implement **NPCs** with basic AI routines  
📌 Develop faction-based interactions leading to rebellion mechanics  
📌 Enhance environmental interactivity (more objects, puzzles, worldbuilding)  

### **Phase 3: Full Sandbox & Uprising Mechanics**  
📌 Expand to a **fully simulated underground society**  
📌 Introduce crafting, combat, and leadership mechanics  
📌 Allow dynamic consequences (authoritarian rule vs. rebellion leadership)  
📌 Finalize asset polish, UI/UX refinements, and storytelling depth

## **Art Style & Setting**

🎨 **Visual Style:**  
- Gritty, **Source Engine-era aesthetics**  
- Low-poly but atmospheric, emphasizing **environmental storytelling**  
- UI will be minimal, enhancing **diegetic interactions**  

🏢 **Game Setting:**  
- A massive **underground dystopian city**  
- Citizens wear **matching uniforms**, identified by numbers  
- Players will engage in **routine tasks**, including **mandatory medication** (compliance affects health/suspicion levels)  
- **Heavily monitored society**, but secrets exist for those who dare to look

## **Development Process (AGILE SCRUM Approach)**

**Sprint Planning:** Two-week sprints with specific deliverables  
**Standups:** Regular check-ins for progress updates  
**Backlog Management:** Prioritization of essential tasks  

### **Sprint 1: Core Systems & Prototyping (Weeks 1-2)**  
✅ Create Unity Project & Set Up Version Control  
✅ Implement **basic player movement & interaction**  
✅ Start work on **procedural apartment layout** system  
✅ Develop simple **physics-based object interactions**  

### **Sprint 2: Expanding Interactivity (Weeks 3-4)**  
✅ Add interactable objects (mirrors, IDs, personal items)  
✅ Implement day/night cycle & time-based mechanics  
✅ Introduce basic UI elements (inventory, character stats tracking)  

### **Sprint 3: First Playable Demo (Weeks 5-6)**  
✅ Refine procedural generation (apartments & player character)  
✅ Integrate early environmental storytelling elements  
✅ Internal testing & iteration based on feedback  

_(Future sprints will further develop NPC AI, sandbox mechanics, and rebellion systems)_
