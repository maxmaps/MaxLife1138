I am looking to develop a video game using Unity and have a draft of my project plan along with some concept art created using DALL-E. I would like assistance in creating a PDF that summarizes my notes and includes a schedule based on the AGILE Scrum sprint planning system. 

The PDF should be visually appealing, incorporating colors, emojis, tables, diagrams, and concept art. I intend to print and laminate this PDF, then share copies with friends who are interested in helping with different aspects of the project.

Once the PDF is complete, Iâ€™d also appreciate help in developing the game from the ground up. Thank you!
