**Project Name:** The Max-Life1138 Project

**Project Goals, Scope, and Features:**

- Develop a single-player FPS inspired by the Half-Life series, focusing on physics, aesthetics, and graphics. The game will emphasize procedurally generated levels, randomizing layouts, NPCs, the player character, and the player's in-game apartment with each new game.

- The first demo will showcase the player's living quarters, which will have a randomized layout and style. The player's character will be randomized as well, with details only viewable through the environment (e.g., mirrors, wallets, and apartment items). Character stats will also be randomized and hidden from view outside of developer tools.

- The second demo will include a small procedurally generated apartment complex, with future versions potentially introducing NPCs.

- Initial character models can be blocky, reminiscent of Minecraft, Roblox, or Stalcraft, but a preference exists for them to resemble characters from Half-Life 2.

- The game initially focuses on sandbox gameplay and life-sim features, including a day and night cycle requiring the player to return to their apartment by a certain hour.

- The primary goal is for the player to lead an uprising against the authoritarian regime in charge of the facility, progressing through game mechanics rather than a scripted questline.

- The endgame involves overseeing a sector of the facility, allowing players to build up their infrastructure, defenses, and governance systems, with options to be either a loyal revolutionary or an authoritarian ruler.

- Gameplay will include collecting personal items, customizing living spaces, and upgrading parts of the facility using a minimal inventory that reflects the player's limited storage access.

- Crafting mechanics will allow players to combine items found in the environment, with early-game weapons such as improvised tools and progressing to guard equipment and firearms.

- Physics-based interactions will feel intuitive and rewarding, emphasizing environmental storytelling and puzzle-solving similar to Half-Life.

**Art Style and Setting:**

- The game will utilize a simple, gritty graphical style, reflecting the aesthetics of the Source engine's Half-Life games. Environmental storytelling will be prioritized, with minimal menus/UI elements.

- The project draws inspiration from both the Half-Life series and the film THX 1138.

- Set in a massive underground bunker functioning as a city, the player will take on the role of a citizen, navigating work tasks and scheduled medical administrations that impact gameplay, including a health and suspicion meter related to medication compliance.

- Characters will wear matching uniforms with identification numbers echoing themes from THX 1138, SEN 5241, and LUH 3417.

**Preferred Development Process:**

- Learning by doing is preferred, with a focus on experimenting with mechanics early to grasp the game's code before expanding complexity.

- Creating as many assets from scratch as possible is desired, leveraging a versatile skill set in visual art, music, and basic programming. Relevant hardware includes an audio interface and microphone for sound recording and a drawing tablet for texture creation.Project Name: The Max-Life1138 Project

Project Goals, Scope, and Features:

	- A single-player FPS inspired heavily by the Half-Life series regarding physics and aesthetics/graphics. It will strongly focus on procedurally generating levels by randomizing the layout of the complex with each new game, in addition to randomizing NPCs, the player character, and the player's in-game apartment.

	- The first demo will be contained to the setting of the player's living quarters, which will be randomized in layout and style. Your character will also be randomized each time you start a new game; however, you can only see your character's details via the environment around you, such as looking at a mirror to view your appearance, opening your wallet to look at your ID, and observing the objects and mementos found around the apartment to get an idea of their history and personality. Character stats will be randomized with each new game and will not be viewable without using something like developer tools.

	- The second demo will allow you to exit your apartment and walk around a small, procedurally generated apartment complex. A later version of this demo can include NPCs.

	- Initially, the models of the characters can be blocky people, like in the games Minecraft, Roblox, Battlebit, and Stalcraft. That said, I prefer the models to look similar to the characters in Half-Life 2.

	- Further direction for the game design is up in the air, but I would like it to start with this foundation of procedurally generating the maps and characters. The Max-Life1138 project will begin as a sandbox game with life-sim features, such as a day and night cycle where you must return to your apartment by a particular hour.

	- The main goal would be for your character to create an uprising to take over the facility you are living in and defend it against the authoritarian regime in charge. This will progress through game features rather than a scripted questline.

	- The endgame will involve you being in charge of a sector of the facility that you live in. You and your revolutionaries can build up your facilities, defenses, and commodities, as well as set new laws and a new system of governance. You can be a loyal revolutionary or revert to an authoritarian regime with yourself and your announced council in charge.

	- The game should include many ways to collect personal items (personal mementos and unauthorized contraband), customize your living quarters, and build/upgrade parts of the facility.

	- The game should include a minimal inventory, with the idea that you don't have anywhere to hide and store items on most uniforms. Most items you do not have clearance to interact with will be considered contraband. Crafting can involve picking items up off the ground, moving them on top of a crafting bench, and hitting a button to craft the combined item. Weapons early on will include prison-shank-style crafts and industrial tools (e.g., the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2), progressing towards getting your hands on guard equipment with armor, shields, and batons. Eventually, you will get your hands on firearms and other deadly weapons.

	- The physics of picking up and throwing/placing items should feel quick, easy, and satisfying. Half-Life emphasized puzzle solving and combat based on interacting with the environment, and such should be the same case with the Max-Life1138 project.

Art Style and Setting:

	- The graphical style should be simple and gritty, much like the Source era games of the Half-Life era. Similarly, the game should focus heavily on environmental storytelling and minimal use of menus/UI elements.

	- The project name is Max-Life1138 because it will be inspired by both the Half-Life series and the film THX 1138.

	- The game setting is a massive underground bunker, similar to Black Mesa, except this bunker acts as a city where you can live. You will be taking the role of a citizen like the characters in THX 1138. Work tasks will guide your daily routine, as well as routinely scheduled medical administrations, where you will wait in line for your prescribed medication (there will be repercussions both for your health and suspicion meter for not taking your meds correctly)

	- Most of the characters in the game will be wearing matching uniforms, displaying their name as an identification number (much like the names THX 1138, SEN 5241, and LUH 3417)


Preferred Development Process:

	- I tend to learn best by doing. I have had great experiences learning new things using chatGPT recently, which can also be done.

	- I prefer focusing on coding mechanics first to understand my game's code before it gets too complicated.

	- I would like to create as many assets from scratch as possible. I am a versatile artist, both in visual art, music, and basic programming. I have the hardware to help with this, such as an audio interface and microphone for recording custom sounds and a drawing tablet for drawing my own textures.
